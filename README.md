# Life-Expectancy-Prediction(Python)
By Ning Chen and Yuqian Ran

This is a group project of Stat 441(University of Waterloo). 

We used the provided data to build a model predicting whether people would be satisfied with their life.

The data contains 271 varibles, ids and satisfied(the data used 0/1 to represent whether this person is satisfied with his/her life).

We used LightGBM, RandomForest, and XGBoost to build three different models and selected the model with best performance.
